# PHPExcel - REVIVE

PHPExcel was archived in 2019, but it was archived with a bug that was keeping the excel generator to work, so i forked from the original "phpoffice/phpexcel" because it would give me so much recoding, i couldnt just remove and update this lib in my project.

The orignal project has not be maintained for years and must not be used anymore. **All users must migrate** to its direct successor [PhpSpreadsheet](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet), or another alternative.
